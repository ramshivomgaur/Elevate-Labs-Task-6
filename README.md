# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation - Task 6

## 📌 Objective

The objective of this task is to understand what makes a password strong, create multiple passwords with varying complexity, test them using an online password strength checker, and summarize the findings. This promotes cybersecurity awareness and helps in creating better personal and professional security practices.

## 🧪 Passwords Tested

| Password                  | Strength Score (%) | Tool Feedback                                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 123456789098765431        | 29%                | Weak: Too predictable and lacks complexity            |
| aAJ@03                   | 56%                | Moderate: Short but includes some character variety   |
| Aaj@03JunE               | 90%                | Strong: Passphrase style, good length and symbols     |
| Aaaj@0\|3$_june^2#0>2!5   | 100%               | Very Strong: Long, random, mixed character types      |

## ✅ Best Practices Learned

- Use **12 or more characters**.
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoid **dictionary words and personal information**.
- Use **passphrases** that are easy to remember but hard to guess.
- **Never reuse** the same password across different platforms.
- Consider using a **password manager** for safe storage.

## 📚 Common Password Attacks

- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses a list of commonly used passwords or words.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Uses previously leaked username-password pairs.
- **Phishing**: Tricks users into giving up credentials through fake websites or emails.

---

## 🔐 Why Password Complexity Matters

- Simple passwords can be cracked in **seconds**.
- Complex, long passwords can take **years or even centuries** to break.
- A mix of symbols, numbers, and unpredictability drastically increases security.
- Complexity reduces the success rate of common password attacks.
